# Learning to learn

Learning from the Feynman technique. They called ***“The great explainer”***

## The feynman technique

If you had a coworker, friend, boss or somebody else, then they probably talked about invesments, negotiations, develop skills or something else and you don’t know how react that... 

The world is HUGE, then you don’t know about all topics but you would might a little bit or maybe learn faster than somebody else.

You’re not alone, ‘cause Freynman develop a technnique for self-taught, pay attention. 

You just put into notebook, book, blog, article or something else, things you don’t know about and then eventually search about that. Tried to find essential information of each subject, just 15 minutes every day and then eventually you know about all topics🙂 

You can use this model to quickly learn new concepts and up to your knowledge, it is important write and so therefore you can read for don’t forget this topics, or just study more efficiently.

> *“In order to talk to each other, we have to have words, and that’s all right. It’s a good idea to try to see the difference, and it’s a good idea to know when we are teaching the tools of science, such as words, and when we are teaching science itself,” Feynman said.*

## Technically the Feynman technique is this:

1. Identify the subject
    1. Write about the topic, and if you find new sources of information, add them to the note. 
2. Teach to duckling
    1. If you teach about the new topic with simple words then you know the topic perfectly 
3. Identify your knowledge
    1. In this point you really know what is the real learning happens. Find new sources and then, question it what are you missing? or what you don’t know? or something else... 
    2. If you don’t know something, hit the books, articles, google, youtube,  stack overflow (for programmers) or Udemy my favorite place
4. Organize + simplify + tell a story
    1. Start to tell your story, You write all about you know about the topic
    2. Practice reading your story out loud, pretend you teach at a classroom with a lot of students
    3. Use analogies and simple sentences to share your understanding of the story

This sentence, written by Feynman, encapsulates the power of this technique. What started as a question about our existence has been translated into a single sentence that can be understood by a middle school student.
